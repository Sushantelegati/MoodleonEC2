Moodle configuration procedures?

 Step1: Configuring the PHP (7.4) for Moodle 

1. Verify the Ubuntu system packages are current. 

# sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade 

Verify the Confirm the active release of PHP. php -v 

2. PHP release 7.4 is necessary for Moodle to operate correctly. PHP 7.4 must be installed if PHP 8.x is the current release. Add the ondrej repository, then use apt install to install PHP 7.4. 

# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php 

# sudo apt-get update

#  sudo apt install php7.4 libapache2-mod-php7.4 

# sudo apt install graphviz aspell ghostscript clamav php7.4-pspell php7.4-curl php7.4-gd php7.4-intl php7.4-mysql php7.4-xml php7.4-xmlrpc php7.4-ldap php7.4-zip php7.4-soap php7.4-mbstring git

3. Enter the number that corresponds to release 7.4 after reviewing the list of accessible releases. 

# sudo update-alternatives --config PHP 

4. Reload Apache to apply the changes. 

# sudo systemctl restart apache2

Step2: Downloading Moodle for Ubuntu 22.04

Move to the /opt directory, and clone the Moodle Git repository. 

# cd /opt 

# sudo git clone git://git.moodle.org/moodle.git 

# cd moodle 

2. Review the list and determine whether the branch matches the latest stable release.

# sudo git branch -a 

3. Track and check out the appropriate branch. 

# sudo git branch --track MOODLE_400_STABLE origin/MOODLE_400_STABLE 

# sudo git checkout MOODLE_400_STABLE 

4. Copy the contents of the Moodle repository to the root directory for the domain. 

# sudo cp -R /opt/moodle /var/www/html/ sudo chmod -R 0777 /var/www/html/moodle 

5. Create the /var/moodledata directory and change the directory owner and permissions. 

# sudo mkdir /var/moodledata 

# sudo chown -R www-data /var/moodledata 

# sudo chmod -R 0777 /var/moodledata

Step3: Configuring the MySQL Server for Moodle

1.

# sudo apt update 

# sudo apt install mysql-server -y 

# systemctl is-active MySQL 

# systemctl is-active MySQL 

# systemctl status mysql.service 

2. Log in to MySQL as the root user. The SQL prompt should appear. 

# sudo mysql -u root -p 

3. Create a database for Moodle to use. MySQL should respond with Query OK. 

CREATE DATABASE moodle DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci; 

4. Create a Moodle MySQL user. Grant them permissions for the database. 

CREATE USER 'moodle-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 

GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,DROP,INDEX,ALTER ON moodle.* TO 'moodle-user'@'localhost'; 

5. Exit the MySQL database. 

quit
